# 🦐 Gump-Shell Plugin for Oh-My-Zsh 🦐

Welcome to the **Gump-Shell** plugin, an open-source project by Bubba Gump Shrimp Co. This plugin brings a touch of shrimp to your shell, requiring every command to be prefixed with the word "shrimp". Because, as Bubba always said, "Life is like a box of shrimp; you never know what you're gonna shell."

## Installation

Follow these simple steps to install the Gump-Shell plugin:

1. **Clone the Repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/bubba-gump-shrimp-co/gump-shell.git ~/.oh-my-zsh/plugins/gump-shell
    ```

2. **Enable the Plugin:**

    Open your `.zshrc` file and add `gump-shell` to the list of plugins. Your plugins line should look something like this:

    ```zsh
    plugins=(git gump-shell)
    ```

3. **Source Your `.zshrc`:**

    To activate the plugin, source your `.zshrc` file:

    ```bash
    source ~/.zshrc
    ```

## Usage

Once installed, every command in your shell needs to be prefixed with "shrimp". For example:

```bash
shrimp ls
shrimp git status
shrimp echo "Life is like a box of shrimp"
```
